README for makefiles for H@H client

* Install

Select either the makefile for apache ant only (without ivy) or for apache ant
with ivy.  You can download apache ant from (http://ant.apache.org/) and apache
ivy from (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/).  Note that if you use the makefile for
apache ant only you will need to provide the jars H@H client depends on
yourself (the only dependency as of this writing is sqlite-jdbc-3.7.2).

These makefiles shall work with ant 1.7.1 or later (the current release as of
this writing is ant 1.9.3), and with ivy 2.1.0 or later (the current release as
of this writing is ivy 2.3.0).  Successful tests were performed with
combinations of ant 1.7.1, ant 1.9.3, ivy 2.1.0 and ivy 2.3.0.

* Build

Use ant -p to list all build targets.  The most important build targets are the
default target (attained by running ant without arguments) that builds the jars
needed to run H@H client; and the "clean" target which removes all files used
for the build.
